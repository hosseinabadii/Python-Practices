# Context Manager

In Python, a context manager is a construct that allows for the allocation and release of resources, such as files or network connections, in a way that is safe and efficient. A context manager is typically implemented as a class that defines two methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`.

The `__enter__` method is called when the context is entered, and it returns the resource that needs to be managed. The `__exit__` method is called when the context is exited, either normally or due to an exception, and it releases the resource. Context managers are useful in situations where you need to ensure that a resource is properly allocated and released, even in the presence of exceptions.

One common use case for context managers is file operations. When working with files, it is important to ensure that the file is properly closed after it is no longer needed, even if an exception occurs. Context managers make it easy to ensure that files are properly closed by automatically releasing the file resource when the context is exited.

Using a context manager in this way ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs while reading the file. This can help prevent resource leaks and make code more efficient and reliable.
