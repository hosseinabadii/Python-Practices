# Multiprocessing

It is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computerâ€™s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound **for** loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.

**Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. The Python standard library has offered longstanding support for `multiprocessing` packages.
